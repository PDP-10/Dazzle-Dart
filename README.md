## Dazzle Dart

This is a game created by Hal Abelson, Nat Goodman, and Andy diSessa.
It ran on the MIT Logo group PDP-11/45 in the mid 1970s and used a one
of a kind display system by Tom Knight.  It's based on the short story
[*"Bullard
Reflects"*](https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/jamesonm-bullard06bullardreflects/jamesonm-bullard06bullardreflects-00-h.html)
by Malcom Jameson.  The source for the ACM SIGCUE article [*"Dazzle
dart: reflections on computer
games"*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1216479.1216482) is
included.

There was an attempt to port it to the AI Lab PDP-6 and 10 using the
Type 340 display.  The scanned listing is included, and it has been
converted to a machine readable file though there may still be typos.
Version 122 comes from a tape image.

There is some more information
[here](https://www.kaleberg.com/dazzle/dazzle.html), and the game was
featured in the Optics & Photoics News article [*"Playing With
Light"*](https://www.osa-opn.org/home/articles/volume_18/issue_10/departments/light_touch/playing_with_light_a_history_of_games_that_incorp/).

Here is the game seen running on a PDP-11 emulator.
